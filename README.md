Liam's JS Library: A place for my personal JS toolbox.

A place for me to put all the functions I keep replicating in new sites and projects. I'm pretty tired of doing that, so I'm putting them all here for my convenience.

Setting up for builds:
1. Clone this repo
2. As root, execute:
	a. npm install -g karma-cli

Cheers!
